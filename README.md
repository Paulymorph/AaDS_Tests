# AaDS_Tests
The repo is for testing the realisations of the tasks on the Algorithms and Data Structures course.

Each folder of the repository represents a problem to be solved.

Some hints on naming:
    Test case name is the name of the structure to be tested + 'Test'
    Test name is the name of the functionality being tested (camelCase) + the number of the test (beware of naming collisions)
